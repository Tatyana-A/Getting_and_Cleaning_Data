Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project

The attached run_analysis.R script creates a new dataset from Samsung data
placed at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The script assumes that the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" from ZIP archive with Samsung data is placed in working directory.
